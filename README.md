# One-way Communication with Component Props

You can communicate from parent to child components using `props`.
Read more about props [here](https://github.com/DED8IRD/NodeReactFullStack/blob/master/2%20React/docs/Props.md).

In this section, we want pass props within `App.js` to its child components.

- `<Header />` will take in `title` and `subtitle` as props
- `<Todos />` will take `todos` as a prop.
- `<Todo />` will take `todo` as a prop.


Don't worry about getting all the functionalities working yet.  Just make sure the components are being properly rendered to screen with their props.

# What Todo App

This is the project repo for **What Todo** - a guide for the React portion of PDX Code Guild's [Node & React Full Stack Bootcamp](https://github.com/DED8IRD/NodeReactFullStack).

Each branch contains a portion of the project, which is typically divided by conceptual segments. Within each, we begin from the basics of React and JSX and work our way up to the final realized What Todo application. 

There is a detailed README describing the tasks and goals of each branch. There are usually code stubs or a simplified example located in [`./what-todo-app/src/playground/`](./what-todo-app/src/playground/) that is intended to guide you to the solution. 

The solutions for each section are located within the branch (typically in [`./what-todo-app/src/App.js`](./what-todo-app/src/App.js) unless otherwise noted). I highly recommend attempting the section tasks yourself before going over the solution.
